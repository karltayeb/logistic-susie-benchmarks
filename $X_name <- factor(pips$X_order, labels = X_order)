     The function ‘factor’ is used to encode a vector as a factor (the
     terms ‘category’ and ‘enumerated type’ are also used for factors).
     If argument ‘ordered’ is ‘TRUE’, the factor levels are assumed to
     be ordered.  For compatibility with S there is also a function
     ‘ordered’.

     ‘is.factor’, ‘is.ordered’, ‘as.factor’ and ‘as.ordered’ are the
     membership and coercion functions for these classes.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     factor(x = character(), levels, labels = levels,
            exclude = NA, ordered = is.ordered(x), nmax = NA)
     
     ordered(x, ...)
     
     is.factor(x)
     is.ordered(x)
     
     as.factor(x)
     as.ordered(x)
     
     addNA(x, ifany = FALSE)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a vector of data, usually taking a small number of distinct
          values.

  levels: an optional vector of the unique values (as character
          strings) that ‘x’ might have taken.  The default is the
          unique set of values taken by ‘as.character(x)’, sorted into
          increasing order _of ‘x’_.  Note that this set can be
          specified as smaller than ‘sort(unique(x))’.

  labels: _either_ an optional character vector of labels for the
          levels (in the same order as ‘levels’ after removing those in
          ‘exclude’), _or_ a character string of length 1.  Duplicated
          values in ‘labels’ can be used to map different values of ‘x’
          to the same factor level.

 exclude: a vector of values to be excluded when forming the set of
          levels.  This may be factor with the same level set as ‘x’ or
          should be a ‘character’.

 ordered: logical flag to determine if the levels should be regarded as
          ordered (in the order given).

    nmax: an upper bound on the number of levels; see ‘Details’.

     ...: (in ‘ordered(.)’): any of the above, apart from ‘ordered’
          itself.

   ifany: only add an ‘NA’ level if it is used, i.e.  if
          ‘any(is.na(x))’.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The type of the vector ‘x’ is not restricted; it only must have an
     ‘as.character’ method and be sortable (by ‘order’).

     Ordered factors differ from factors only in their class, but
     methods and the model-fitting functions treat the two classes
     quite differently.

     The encoding of the vector happens as follows.  First all the
     values in ‘exclude’ are removed from ‘levels’. If ‘x[i]’ equals
     ‘levels[j]’, then the ‘i’-th element of the result is ‘j’.  If no
     match is found for ‘x[i]’ in ‘levels’ (which will happen for
     excluded values) then the ‘i’-th element of the result is set to
     ‘NA’.

     Normally the ‘levels’ used as an attribute of the result are the
     reduced set of levels after removing those in ‘exclude’, but this
     can be altered by supplying ‘labels’.  This should either be a set
     of new labels for the levels, or a character string, in which case
     the levels are that character string with a sequence number
     appended.

     ‘factor(x, exclude = NULL)’ applied to a factor without ‘NA’s is a
     no-operation unless there are unused levels: in that case, a
     factor with the reduced level set is returned.  If ‘exclude’ is
     used, since R version 3.4.0, excluding non-existing character
     levels is equivalent to excluding nothing, and when ‘exclude’ is a
     ‘character’ vector, that _is_ applied to the levels of ‘x’.
     Alternatively, ‘exclude’ can be factor with the same level set as
     ‘x’ and will exclude the levels present in ‘exclude’.

     The codes of a factor may contain ‘NA’.  For a numeric ‘x’, set
     ‘exclude = NULL’ to make ‘NA’ an extra level (prints as ‘<NA>’);
     by default, this is the last level.

     If ‘NA’ is a level, the way to set a code to be missing (as
     opposed to the code of the missing level) is to use ‘is.na’ on the
     left-hand-side of an assignment (as in ‘is.na(f)[i] <- TRUE’;
     indexing inside ‘is.na’ does not work).  Under those circumstances
     missing values are currently printed as ‘<NA>’, i.e., identical to
     entries of level ‘NA’.

     ‘is.factor’ is generic: you can write methods to handle specific
     classes of objects, see InternalMethods.

     Where ‘levels’ is not supplied, ‘unique’ is called.  Since factors
     typically have quite a small number of levels, for large vectors
     ‘x’ it is helpful to supply ‘nmax’ as an upper bound on the number
     of unique values.

     Since R 4.1.0, when using ‘c’ to combine a (possibly ordered)
     factor with other objects, if all objects are (possibly ordered)
     factors, the result will be a factor with levels the union of the
     level sets of the elements, in the order the levels occur in the
     level sets of the elements (which means that if all the elements
     have the same level set, that is the level set of the result),
     equivalent to how ‘unlist’ operates on a list of factor objects.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     ‘factor’ returns an object of class ‘"factor"’ which has a set of
     integer codes the length of ‘x’ with a ‘"levels"’ attribute of
     mode ‘character’ and unique (‘!anyDuplicated(.)’) entries.  If
     argument ‘ordered’ is true (or ‘ordered()’ is used) the result has
     class ‘c("ordered", "factor")’.  Undocumentedly for a long time,
     ‘factor(x)’ loses all ‘attributes(x)’ but ‘"names"’, and resets
     ‘"levels"’ and ‘"class"’.

     Applying ‘factor’ to an ordered or unordered factor returns a
     factor (of the same type) with just the levels which occur: see
     also ‘[.factor’ for a more transparent way to achieve this.

     ‘is.factor’ returns ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ depending on whether its
     argument is of type factor or not.  Correspondingly, ‘is.ordered’
     returns ‘TRUE’ when its argument is an ordered factor and ‘FALSE’
     otherwise.

     ‘as.factor’ coerces its argument to a factor.  It is an
     abbreviated (sometimes faster) form of ‘factor’.

     ‘as.ordered(x)’ returns ‘x’ if this is ordered, and ‘ordered(x)’
     otherwise.

     ‘addNA’ modifies a factor by turning ‘NA’ into an extra level (so
     that ‘NA’ values are counted in tables, for instance).

     ‘.valid.factor(object)’ checks the validity of a factor, currently
     only ‘levels(object)’, and returns ‘TRUE’ if it is valid,
     otherwise a string describing the validity problem.  This function
     is used for ‘validObject(<factor>)’.

_W_a_r_n_i_n_g:

     The interpretation of a factor depends on both the codes and the
     ‘"levels"’ attribute.  Be careful only to compare factors with the
     same set of levels (in the same order).  In particular,
     ‘as.numeric’ applied to a factor is meaningless, and may happen by
     implicit coercion.  To transform a factor ‘f’ to approximately its
     original numeric values, ‘as.numeric(levels(f))[f]’ is recommended
     and slightly more efficient than ‘as.numeric(as.character(f))’.

     The levels of a factor are by default sorted, but the sort order
     may well depend on the locale at the time of creation, and should
     not be assumed to be ASCII.

     There are some anomalies associated with factors that have ‘NA’ as
     a level.  It is suggested to use them sparingly, e.g., only for
     tabulation purposes.

     There are ‘"factor"’ and ‘"ordered"’ methods for the group generic
     ‘Ops’ which provide methods for the Comparison operators, and for
     the ‘min’, ‘max’, and ‘range’ generics in ‘Summary’ of
     ‘"ordered"’.  (The rest of the groups and the ‘Math’ group
     generate an error as they are not meaningful for factors.)

     Only ‘==’ and ‘!=’ can be used for factors: a factor can only be
     compared to another factor with an identical set of levels (not
     necessarily in the same ordering) or to a character vector.
     Ordered factors are compared in the same way, but the general
     dispatch mechanism precludes comparing ordered and unordered
     factors.

     All the comparison operators are available for ordered factors.
     Collation is done by the levels of the operands: if both operands
     are ordered factors they must have the same level set.

_N_o_t_e:

     In earlier versions of R, storing character data as a factor was
     more space efficient if there is even a small proportion of
     repeats.  However, identical character strings now share storage,
     so the difference is small in most cases.  (Integer values are
     stored in 4 bytes whereas each reference to a character string
     needs a pointer of 4 or 8 bytes.)

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     ‘[.factor’ for subsetting of factors.

     ‘gl’ for construction of balanced factors and ‘C’ for factors with
     specified contrasts.  ‘levels’ and ‘nlevels’ for accessing the
     levels, and ‘unclass’ to get integer codes.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     (ff <- factor(substring("statistics", 1:10, 1:10), levels = letters))
     as.integer(ff)      # the internal codes
     (f. <- factor(ff))  # drops the levels that do not occur
     ff[, drop = TRUE]   # the same, more transparently
     
     factor(letters[1:20], labels = "letter")
     
     class(ordered(4:1)) # "ordered", inheriting from "factor"
     z <- factor(LETTERS[3:1], ordered = TRUE)
     ## and "relational" methods work:
     stopifnot(sort(z)[c(1,3)] == range(z), min(z) < max(z))
     
     
     ## suppose you want "NA" as a level, and to allow missing values.
     (x <- factor(c(1, 2, NA), exclude = NULL))
     is.na(x)[2] <- TRUE
     x  # [1] 1    <NA> <NA>
     is.na(x)
     # [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE
     
     ## More rational, since R 3.4.0 :
     factor(c(1:2, NA), exclude =  "" ) # keeps <NA> , as
     factor(c(1:2, NA), exclude = NULL) # always did
     ## exclude = <character>
     z # ordered levels 'A < B < C'
     factor(z, exclude = "C") # does exclude
     factor(z, exclude = "B") # ditto
     
     ## Now, labels maybe duplicated:
     ## factor() with duplicated labels allowing to "merge levels"
     x <- c("Man", "Male", "Man", "Lady", "Female")
     ## Map from 4 different values to only two levels:
     (xf <- factor(x, levels = c("Male", "Man" , "Lady",   "Female"),
                      labels = c("Male", "Male", "Female", "Female")))
     #> [1] Male   Male   Male   Female Female
     #> Levels: Male Female
     
     ## Using addNA()
     Month <- airquality$Month
     table(addNA(Month))
     table(addNA(Month, ifany = TRUE))
